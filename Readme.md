# Kubernetes Homelab
This repo contains configuration files and documentation for setting up a Kubernetes homelab environment. The k8s cluster was setup using kind (Kubernetes IN Docker) for easy local development and testing.

> Note: This Kubernetes homelab configuration was developed on Windows 11 with Ubuntu WSL2, running Docker Engine within WSL2 and using Kind to manage Kubernetes clusters.
